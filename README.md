# Project Features

## 1. Parking Spot Graph

**Graph Representation:** 
Use Python's `networkx` library to visually represent the parking spots as nodes and their relationships as edges.

**Graph Algorithms:** 
Leverage `networkx`'s graph algorithms to efficiently find the shortest path between an entry point and an available parking spot.

## 2. Chatbot (AI)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
Implement an intelligent chatbot using Python libraries such as `spaCy` or `NLTK` for robust natural language processing capabilities.

**Chatbot Frameworks:**
Consider utilizing frameworks like `Rasa` for constructing a conversational AI system. This allows you to easily define intents, entities, and dialogue flows using Python.

## 3. Car Entry

**License Plate Recognition (LPR):**
Implement a sophisticated car entry system by employing Python libraries like `OpenCV` or `EasyOCR` for accurate and efficient license plate recognition.

**IoT Sensors:**
Integrate Python seamlessly with IoT devices or sensors at entry points, utilizing platforms like `Raspberry Pi` or `Arduino` for enhanced functionality.

## 4. Car Exit + Payment Gateway

**Exit Confirmation:**
Implement a secure exit confirmation mechanism using LPR or RFID tags in Python to ensure accurate tracking of departing vehicles.

**Payment Integration:**
Integrate secure payment features seamlessly into your system by utilizing Python SDKs provided by payment gateways such as `Stripe` or `PayPal`.

## 5. Integration

**APIs:**
Develop robust RESTful APIs using popular Python frameworks like `Flask` or `Django` to facilitate smooth communication between different modules within the system.

**Webhooks:**
Utilize the flexibility of `Flask` for handling webhooks, ensuring real-time updates and event-triggered actions throughout the system.

## 6. User Interface

**Web Application:**
Create dynamic web interfaces using Python frameworks like `Flask` or `Django` for user-friendly interactions and real-time updates.

**Mobile Application:**
Consider frameworks like `Kivy` or `BeeWare` to develop cross-platform mobile applications in Python, providing a consistent experience for users on various devices.

**GUI Application:**
Implement graphical user interfaces (GUI) for parking attendants or facility owners using Python GUI libraries such as `Tkinter` or `PyQt`.
